								<h2>Skeuomorphism</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Skeuomorphism is the concept of designing something so that users immediately recognize how to use it. Designers have learned to make things look like common objects so that they can recall its function. An example of this is the trashcan on the home screen of computers. Users recognize that trash is where the stuff they don’t want anymore goes. This is more simple than explaining to someone how to delete a file. Skeuomorphism has to do with web design and creating a user interface with usability. 
								While skeuomorphism appears to represent the real world digitally, there are other ways of designing user interfaces that are very different. Flat design is the opposite method of design which is much more simple. One one hand, skeuomorphism takes the stance that users are uneducated and attempt to make it as easy as possible for people to instantly understand how a system works. However, “flat design proponents argue that device users have grown more sophisticated and no longer require that degree of replication” (WhatIs.com, 2013). 
								I think that the best example of skeuomorphism is the picture of a pencil and paper that appears at the top left of the screen when in the mail and messaging applications. This button leads to composing a new message. This function would be very difficult to simply explain. Even though this is a very simple use of skeuomorphism that is much like the trash can icon, it represents so many amazing things that skeuomorphism can accomplish when used by creative designers. For instance, designers have created much more sophisticated uses for skeuomorphism such as the iBooks main page. It is designed to look like a real bookshelf and the ibooks on it look like 3D books. This is very familiar to users and make it easier to use for many people.
